    This project runs in node. You are presented with a series of questions to build a page containing a Team consisting of a Manager and as many Engineers and Interns that you desire to have on the team. The page will have each member displayed with their Name, their role, the Employee ID and their email. The Manager will have an office number, the Engineer will have a link to their github profile and the Intern will have the school they attended displayed.
